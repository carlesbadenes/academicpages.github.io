Stellar Multiplicity with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
====

The [Sloan Digital Sky Survey](https://www.sdss.org/) has collected millions of spectra of individual objects, from quasars to galaxies and stars. Most of these spectra have a time-domain aspect to them, and it is possible to study them to look for variations in radial velocity (RV) due to the presence of an unseen companion. I have been involved in several efforts to use these data to improve our knowledge of stellar multiplicity.

- White Dwarfs: These objects are degenerate, which makes them very dense and small - a typical white dwarf is roughly the size of planet Earth. As a consequence, white dwarfs can be in binary systems with very short periods, sometimes only a few minutes. These short period binary white dwarfs are very interesting because they can be the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In 2009, we used time-domain SDSS spectra to discover some of these systems ([Badenes et al. 2009](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...707..971B), [Mullally et al. 2009](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...707L..51M)). In 2012, we took these studies one step further, using the statistical properties of thousands of individual radial velocities measured by SDSS ([Maoz et al. 20102](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...751..143M)) to constrain the merger rate of binary white dwarfs in the Milky Way ([Badenes & Maoz 2012](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...749L..11B)). We have recently revised this measurement with new data, concluding that binary white dwarfs merge at a very high rate ([Maoz et al. 2018](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.476.2584M))
