Stellar Multiplicity with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
====

The [Sloan Digital Sky Survey](https://www.sdss.org/) has collected millions of spectra of individual objects, from quasars to galaxies and stars. Most of these spectra have a time-domain aspect to them, and it is possible to study them to look for variations in radial velocity (RV) due to the presence of an unseen companion. I have been involved in several efforts to use these data to improve our knowledge of stellar multiplicity.
