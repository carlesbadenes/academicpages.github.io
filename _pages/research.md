Stellar Multiplicity with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey  <a id="stellar-mult"></a>
====

The [Sloan Digital Sky Survey](https://www.sdss.org/) has collected millions of spectra of individual objects, from quasars to galaxies and stars. Most of these spectra have multiple visits, and it is possible to study them to look for variations in radial velocity (RV) due to the presence of an unseen binary companion. I have been involved in several efforts to use these data to improve our knowledge of stellar multiplicity. 

I am proud to announce that I have become an Associate Member of the fifth installment of SDSS, [SDSS-V](https://www.sdss.org/future/), scheduled to begin operations in 2020. This survey will revolutionize our knowledge of the stellar content of the Milky Way, so stay tuned for developments!

- <b>White Dwarfs</b>: These degenerate stars are very dense and small - a typical white dwarf is roughly the size of planet Earth. As a consequence, they can be in binary systems with very short periods, sometimes only a few minutes. These short period binary white dwarfs are very interesting because they can be the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In 2009, we used time-domain SDSS spectra to discover some of these systems ([Badenes et al. 2009](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...707..971B), [Mullally et al. 2009](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...707L..51M)). In 2012, we took these studies one step further, using the statistical properties of thousands of individual radial velocities measured by SDSS ([Maoz et al. 2012](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...751..143M)) to constrain the merger rate of binary white dwarfs in the Milky Way ([Badenes & Maoz 2012](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...749L..11B), see the [NSF Press Release](https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=123450)). We have recently revised this measurement with new data, concluding that binary white dwarfs merge at a very high rate ([Maoz et al. 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.476.2584M))

- <b>Main sequence stars and Red Giants</b>: Thanks to the unprecedented spectral resolution of the [APOGEE](https://www.sdss.org/dr15/irspec/) IR spectrographs in SDSS, we have been able to conduct a systematic exploration of the fundamental statistics of stellar multiplicity and their dependance on stellkar properties, from the Main Sequence to the Horizontal Branch. We found that there is a very strong anti-correlation between stellar metallicity and the fraction of stars with close companions (periods of a few years or less). See [Badenes et al. 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...854..147B/) and [Moe, Kratter, and Badenes 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...875...61M/). 

- Follow-up of interesting systems: Coming soon.

Supernova Remnants
====

[Supernova Remnants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova_remnant) are the end products of supernova explosions. I have been studying these fascinating objects since I was a graduate student - you can even download my [Ph D Thesis](/files/Badenes_PhDThesis_2004.pdf) if you like that sort of thing, though much of it is now outdated.
